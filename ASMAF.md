# ASMAF - Abundance of small mammals in the Atlantic Forest 

<p align="justify">The dataset gathered here is a compilation of published scientific articles, book chapters, unpublished theses, dissertations, and monographs, and original unpublished data on species abundance that covers the whole extension of the Atlantic Forest, from northeastern Brazil to northern Argentina. It is probably the most comprehensive dataset for species abundance in a tropical rainforest. It includes 1,805 registers of at least 119 species in 140 localities, totaling 41,740 individuals represented here. In addition, we present additional information regarding the sampled localities, as ecoregion, predominant vegetation type, and biogeographic subdivision.</p>

<b>C. Data set description:</b>
<p align="justify">Here we present a comprehensive dataset for small mammal abundance in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Data were extracted from 105 published sources and from unpublished data collected by our research groups spanning from 1943 to 2017, and includes 1,805 registers of at least 119 species in 140 localities, totaling 41,740 individuals represented here. We selected studies which (i) were conducted in forested habitats of the Atlantic Forest (ii) had a minimum sampling effort of at least 500 trap-nights, and (iii) had to present species abundance data in details. For each study, we recorded (i) latitude and longitude, (ii) name of the locality, (iii) employed sampling effort, (iv) type of traps used, (v) study year, (vi) country, and (vii) species name with (viii) its respective abundances, and for every location we also obtained information regarding its (ix) ecoregion, (x) predominant vegetation type, and (xi) biogeographic subdivision. Whenever necessary, we also (xii) updated the species names as new species were described and some genera suffered taxonomic revision since the articles were published. The locations are spread across the Atlantic Forest and most of the species of small mammals know for the Atlantic Forest are present on this dataset, thus making this dataset representative of communities of this biome. This dataset can be used to address various patterns in community ecology and geographical ecology, as the relation between local abundance and environmental suitability, hypothesis regarding local and regional factors on community structuring, species abundance distributions (SAD), and functional and phylogenetic mechanisms on community assembling.</p>
